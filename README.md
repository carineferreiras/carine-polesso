# My Personal Website
Welcome to my personal Website and Portfolio! Here, I show the skills I've learned as a Software Engineer and the projects that I've worked on. With my background as a designer, I combine, simple and easy layouts to navigate. This website was built from scratch using HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript and then published on GitHub Pages.
